# This is an example of the DAITSS configuration file restricted to
# the data necessary to run the core service.
#
# You must set up your web server to set the environment variable
# DAITSS_CONFIG to point to a configuration file along these lines,
# though typically it will have sections for many services in addition
# to this one.
#
# Please don't use tabs in this file.

defaults:

database:
     daitss_db: postgres://user:pass@host/database    

#   We normally name sections after the virtual hostname used by an
#   applcation (this is so one physical host can run multiple services
#   of the same kind).  An application's configuration code typically
#   checks the VIRTUAL_HOSTNAME environment variable to determine the
#   appropriate section to load.  Typically VIRTUAL_HOSTNAME is set in
#   the same place that the DAITSS_CONFIG environment is set.
