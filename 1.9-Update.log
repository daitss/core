1. need to install sys-proctable gem outside of bundler.

2. If getting a  "fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git",
update bundle gem (https://github.com/bundler/bundler/issues/2039).

3. Gemfile
   - Change gem 'libxml-ruby', "1.1.3"
     to gem 'libxml-ruby'
   - ruby-debug is deprecated in 1.9.  Change gem "ruby-debug"
     to gem debugger
   - the new version of haml gem is separate from sass.  Add gem 'sass' to Gemfile
   - Change the path of the sys-proctable gem to the installed gem path in ruby 1.9

4. Config.ru
   - Ruby 1.9 remove current directory from load path, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9750610/ruby-require-error-cannot-load-such-file.
     Change require 'app'
     to
     require './app'

5. process.rb
   digest.rb
   PLATFORM is deprecated, use RUBY_PLATFORM

6. line 50 in from_sip.rb, change to
     :linking_agents => [ agent_uri ]

7. Alignment in submit.rb is messed up (though not related to ruby 1.9), realign it properly.

8. line 26 in preserve.rb, change to
     raise "error while processing #{df.id}(#{df['aip-path']}): " + e.message
